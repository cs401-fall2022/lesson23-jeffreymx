## Instructions

For the **Experience** section you need to detail your experience with this lab. 

- Were there any things that you struggled with? 
- Were there any parts of this lab that were unclear or poorly specified? 
- Were you able to get the entire project done?

For the **Known issues or Bugs** section you need to detail any issues or bugs that you have in your
code. For example maybe your code crashes randomly and you couldn't figure out why. If your code
doesn't have any issues you can simply write NONE in this section.

For the **Sources used** section you must detail any sources you used outside of the textbook or
course website. If you write NONE in this section it is assumed that you didn't use google at all.
Be safe CITE!

## Experience

I tried really hard to write a webpage in html and create a database (sqlite3).  Both worked great but 
I could not link them.  I finally went back to lab 10 and reworked my website based off that lab.  I am 
still not a huge fan of the pug code but I am sure the more I play with it the better I will understand 
it.  A lot of my code is based off lab 10 but I think I have a little better feel for how it is all 
working between index.pug and index.js.  

## Known issues or Bugs

I do not have any issus that I am aware of at this point.  There are things I would like to do 
differently but would need more time to play around with the code.

## Sources used

Lots of starter code from class!  I used an html to pug engine to help get my html code into pug 
(html-to-pug.com).
